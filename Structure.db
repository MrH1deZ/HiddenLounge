Everything should be optimized and made for all devices PC, mobile and tablets, all requests within to be fixed so if one action is made and the page is force refreshed not to perform the same action but just to refresh the page and after action is performed to auto update the changes and visualize it after the action. Please made every page on separate file and also CSS, js, ajax and everything else also to be in separate files. All functions should be structured in functions/*.php
